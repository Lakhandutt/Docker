# daemon name is httpd most of the apache images are stored with httpd
1. $ docker search httpd
2. $ docker pull httpd
3. $ docker images # list all images
4. $docker run -d --name mywebserver httpd:latest # -d for deattached mode which is used for running 
 container in background 
# containers not expose port outside by default 
# port: a web server is running many services for accessing it from outside we need a port to access.
# ip address is used to reach to the server but port is used to connect the service.
# httpd service is running on port 80 on the container 
5. $ docker ps
# if docker port doesn't give any output it means port is not open/expose
6. $ docker port <container-id>
# how we can expose the port outside?
7. $ docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
 and after login to the container 
8. $ cat /etc/*release ==> ps -ef ==> ps -efa # we can see from output httpd deamons are running
9. $ exit # if we exit from container container is still running because we are running the container
  in deattached mode.

10. $ docker stop <container-id>
11. $ docker top <container-id> #list running processes in container  
12. $ docker rm <container-id>
# we are going to redeploy because we want to redploy it with option expose port 
13. $ docker run -d --name mywebserver -p 80:80 httpd:latest # with option port -p 80:80 means host:container
14. $ docker port mywebserver
15. $ yum install elinks 
16. $ ip r l
